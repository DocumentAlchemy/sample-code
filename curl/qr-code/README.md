## Creating a QR Code using DocumentAlchemy via curl

This directory contains a simple example of using the DocumentAlchemy API to
generate and download a PNG image containing a QR code encoding arbitrary data.

### Basics

The QR code can be generated by a simple curl command. For example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: da.key=$API_KEY" \
     -G https://documentalchemy.com/api/v1/data/-/rendition/qr.png \
     --data-urlencode "data=$DATA" \
     --data-urlencode "size=$SIZE" \
     -o "$DEST"
```

where:

 * `$API_KEY` is replaced by your DocumentAlchemy API key (available at
   <https://documentalchemy.com/my-keys>).

 * `$DATA` is the text to encode into the QR code image.

 * `$SIZE` is the size of the image (in pixels).

 * `$DEST` is the name of the file to save the image to.

For example, if your API key value is `HbblCNv7gLN2pasWFK44`, the command:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: da.key=HbblCNv7gLN2pasWFK44" \
     -G https://documentalchemy.com/api/v1/data/-/rendition/qr.png \
     --data-urlencode "data=Hello World!" \
     -o hello.png
```

will create a file (named `hello.png`) that contains a QR code encoding the text
`Hello World!`. (Note that the `-G` and `--data-urlencode` options make it
possible to pass the text with URL escaping.  I.e. we can write `Hello World!`
rather than `Hello%20World!`.)

As another example, the command:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: da.key=HbblCNv7gLN2pasWFK44" \
     -G https://documentalchemy.com/api/v1/data/-/rendition/qr.png \
     --data-urlencode "data=https://documentalchemy.com" \
     --data-urlencode "size=240"
     -o qr-link.png
```

will create a file (named `qr-link.png`) that links to the DocumentAlchemy home
page at <https://documentalchemy.com/>.  Since we included the `size=240`
parameter, the image will be 240 by 240 pixels, rather than the default 400 by
400 pixels.  (See <https://documentalchemy.com/api-doc/> for more parameters you
can use to control the QR code that is generated.)

### The Script

The `create-qr-code.sh` script encapsulates the curl command above with some
basic command line support.

For help, you may execute:

```bash
create-qr-code.sh --help
```

The general form of the the command is:

```bash
[DA_API_KEY=<API-KEY>] create-qr-code.sh "<DATA>" [<SIZE>] [<DEST>]
```

where:

 * `<API-KEY>` is replaced by your DocumentAlchemy API key (available at
   <https://documentalchemy.com/my-keys>).

 * `<DATA>` is the text to encode into the QR code image.

 * `<SIZE>` is the size of the image (in pixels).

 * `<DEST>` is the name of the file to save the image to.

For example, if your API key value is `HbblCNv7gLN2pasWFK44`, the command:

```bash
DA_API_KEY=HbblCNv7gLN2pasWFK44 create-qr-code.sh "Hello World!" hello.png
```

will create a file (named `hello.png`) that contains a QR code encoding the text
`Hello World!`.

Note that you can also `export` the `DA_API_KEY` value as an environment
variable, or edit the `create-qr-code.sh` script to set your API key as the
default.

See the comments within the file itself for more information about how the
script works.
